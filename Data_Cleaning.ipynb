we did n't love it .</s><s> the next week we saw 9 houses .</s><s> i fell in love with one listed at $ 399,900 .</s><s> we bid $ 450k .</s><s> keep in mind that we have the stipulation that we ca n't cover more than a $ 10k appraisal gap .</s><s> we lost it to someone bidding with cash higher who covered the whole appraisal gap .</s><s> this one was more depressing to lose than the first .</s><s> i did n't expect to be so bummed out , but we figured we 'd try again next time .</s><s> so we saw another 3 houses and fell in love with another one .</s><s> this one was clearly well maintained , but everything about it was from the 70s .</s><s> the carpet was ancient , and all the appliances were outdated .</s><s> it would be a wonderful place to invest in over time and make our own .</s><s> listed at $ 380k , we bid $ 438k and offered to cover some smaller fees like the title transfer .</s><s> this one sold for $ 452k cash .</s><s> yesterday we saw 7 houses and liked 2 .</s><s> the one we like most is listed at $ 399k , but the selling agent informed us they have 200 viewings requested and are getting called 20 - 30 times an hour from people wanting to see it .</s><s> we would offer $ 450k on this one .</s><s> the other one is listed at $ 379k , and we 'd offer $ 420k .</s><s> it feels like it 's not even worth it , though .</s><s> someone out there is sitting on half a million dollars in cash , and we just ca n't beat that .</s><s> i guess i 'm having a little bit of a pity party for myself , but it just does n't feel like we 're going to find something .</s><s> i lowered our requirements to under $ 400k listing price and 1400 square feet .</s><s> there are plenty of houses , but too many buyers .</s><s> it seems like the appraisal gap stipulation and lack of half a million dollars in cash is really hurting us , but these are n't things we can change .</s><s> is it worth it to keep trying until august ?</s><s> do we give up and get a crappy cheap apartment for a year and try to save up more money in hopes that the market does n't get worse ?</s><s> where are people getting their cash , and why are they using it to buy the houses in our range instead of getting something better ?</s><s> is there something else we 're doing wrong ?</s><s> i 've never been more discouraged about anything in my life , and we 're only 3 rejections in .</s><s> multiple people , including our realtor and lender , have said the most rejections they 've seen before something is accepted is 8 .</s><s> i 'm betting we hit a new record .</s><s> edit : putting in another bid today .</s><s> fingers crossed .</s><s> edit 2 : we are n't looking at just denver .</s><s> we 're looking at the whole metro area , focusing mostly on the aurora - ish area .</s><s> the hope with location is that my commute to englewood is less than 45 minutes , but even that is a little flexible .</s><s> we have decent incomes ( $ 135k together ) , and i 'm about to get a promotion .</s><s> both of us have excellent credit .</s><s> it sounds like we just do n't have enough saved up , and only time will fix that .</s><s> we 're fine with fixer - uppers to an extent , just not houses with obvious structural issues we 'd need to spend thousands of dollars repairing in the first year .</s><s> and if the house sucks and is in a bad neighborhood , we wo n't consider it .</s><s> i 'd rather put off the hunt than spend so much on something we hate and live in it for years to come , which might very well be what happens .</s><s> all we can do is keep trying and hope something sticks !</s><s> if it does n't , then our backup plan is to find an inexpensive apartment for a year , save as much as possible , and try again .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48370,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3 month dry spell ends with a surprising amount of jazz sauce .\",\n          \"gme edit : wsb has been taken over by old mods , all the mods who do nt want to monetize the platform have been kicked out . any mods who were actually genuinely here for the community got fucked over for profit . they are trying to monetize the platform and sell us out as we speak .\",\n          \"i 'm an idiot . what 's this button do ? & #x200b ;

thanks for reading this far and please look after yourselves !\",\n          \"so I am 18 f here just because i kind of want to know how i can handle this situation and to know if I am in the wrong / being a bit over dramatic haha , cause i can be sometimes . so my bf and i have been dating for roughly a year now . hes very sweet but he can be very bad with time management and he often loses track of time . i understand things happen , but this happens pretty often and it bugs me . one example thats happened a couple of times is that he would lose track of time with his friends and would forget to call me . for example , we call every night at 9 before going to bed and when sometimes when i called him at 9 , hes with his friends still and hell tell me hell call me at 10 . hell often apologize and say he lost track of time but i would just appreciate it that he just tell me in advance that hes with his friends so hell call me later . I am super happy hes with his friends !! but i would like for him to maybe just check the time for a bit to let me know before hand that well call a whole hour later . ive just never lost track of time like that i guess . if I am with my friends and i notice i might miss the call i tell him a few minutes beforehand . I don't know I am pretty by the book so I don't know . another example is that , once i told him that i was going to his house around 6 which is a bit late cause i had to help my parents with something cause of the persian new year . this holiday is a big deal for my family so helping out was important . anyways , the day of , he told me that i should come at 4 cause they had plans so i had to come earlier . i told him that i can come earlier but id have to reschedule things with my parents and everything and that if its possible , to still do 6 . i was upset since i had to change my schedule the day of . however , when i got there , they did nt even leave until 7 so i still could have come at 6 . like , a little bit of better planning and he could have known it was fine to come for me to come at 6 . i just feel as though my time was a bit disrespected . he once got upset that i came 15 minutes late so i was pretty upset that he did nt hold himself to the same standard . i just want to understand how i should handle these sort of situations and if I am being too over dramatic laughing out loud . ik these happen but i feel like i just try more to prevent these last minute issues .\",\n          \"of course this did n't happened today it happened yesterday . rented a room as i am getting married and my mom told it is a good day , so move in today . i moved it and video called my fiancee to show new rented home which is opposite to gym . talked with her standing near window for 10 mins or so . suddenly bell rang i opened door thinking it must be owner . 4 guys where asking why i am recording girls in gym . i had no idea it took me a second , i explained the situation . they seem sweet only they understood its misunderstanding . later my owner who lives downstairs had bit verbal fight with them asking not to barge in . all is calm now . i am bit scared as i am new to this area . i have been using bedsheet as curtains since then ... till my curtain order arrives .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48363,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"does deleting zotac firestorm delete my rgb profile ?\",\n          \"all dogs are entitled to play in the off leash dog park . is it okay to bring pepper spray to use on other dogs to protect your dog ?\",\n          \"- would i have better luck moving to a smaller populated city , or stay in the bigger city , if I am looking for a long lasting relationship ?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"TLDR_RS_2021-04-cm-8919.json\",\n          \"TLDR_RS_2021-02-cm-12913.json\",\n          \"TLDR_RS_2021-04-cm-4346.json\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rg_labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ext_labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
