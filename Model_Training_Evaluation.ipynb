thanks for reading this far and please look after yourselves !\",\n          \"so I am 18 f here just because i kind of want to know how i can handle this situation and to know if I am in the wrong / being a bit over dramatic haha , cause i can be sometimes . so my bf and i have been dating for roughly a year now . hes very sweet but he can be very bad with time management and he often loses track of time . i understand things happen , but this happens pretty often and it bugs me . one example thats happened a couple of times is that he would lose track of time with his friends and would forget to call me . for example , we call every night at 9 before going to bed and when sometimes when i called him at 9 , hes with his friends still and hell tell me hell call me at 10 . hell often apologize and say he lost track of time but i would just appreciate it that he just tell me in advance that hes with his friends so hell call me later . I am super happy hes with his friends !! but i would like for him to maybe just check the time for a bit to let me know before hand that well call a whole hour later . ive just never lost track of time like that i guess . if I am with my friends and i notice i might miss the call i tell him a few minutes beforehand . I don't know I am pretty by the book so I don't know . another example is that , once i told him that i was going to his house around 6 which is a bit late cause i had to help my parents with something cause of the persian new year . this holiday is a big deal for my family so helping out was important . anyways , the day of , he told me that i should come at 4 cause they had plans so i had to come earlier . i told him that i can come earlier but id have to reschedule things with my parents and everything and that if its possible , to still do 6 . i was upset since i had to change my schedule the day of . however , when i got there , they did nt even leave until 7 so i still could have come at 6 . like , a little bit of better planning and he could have known it was fine to come for me to come at 6 . i just feel as though my time was a bit disrespected . he once got upset that i came 15 minutes late so i was pretty upset that he did nt hold himself to the same standard . i just want to understand how i should handle these sort of situations and if I am being too over dramatic laughing out loud . ik these happen but i feel like i just try more to prevent these last minute issues .\",\n          \"of course this did n't happened today it happened yesterday . rented a room as i am getting married and my mom told it is a good day , so move in today . i moved it and video called my fiancee to show new rented home which is opposite to gym . talked with her standing near window for 10 mins or so . suddenly bell rang i opened door thinking it must be owner . 4 guys where asking why i am recording girls in gym . i had no idea it took me a second , i explained the situation . they seem sweet only they understood its misunderstanding . later my owner who lives downstairs had bit verbal fight with them asking not to barge in . all is calm now . i am bit scared as i am new to this area . i have been using bedsheet as curtains since then ... till my curtain order arrives .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48362,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"i have a crush and my crush likes me back , but my crush is currently in a relationship with one of my friends\",\n          \"* this was a very surprisingly strong and extremely weird experience . i was not at all prepared for the level of dissociation and mind fuck that this combo would give . on the other hand though this combo had some of the best visuals i 've had from any substance so far . i think with a trip sitter and if set during the day , this could have been a near perfect experience . overall 8/10 .\",\n          \"- let us pick between 3 rewards when completing sidequests repeatedly , and make it a small chance that the rewards offered upgrade form rare > epic and even legendaries !

thanks for reading this far and please look after yourselves !\",\n          \"so I am 18 f here just because i kind of want to know how i can handle this situation and to know if I am in the wrong / being a bit over dramatic haha , cause i can be sometimes . so my bf and i have been dating for roughly a year now . hes very sweet but he can be very bad with time management and he often loses track of time . i understand things happen , but this happens pretty often and it bugs me . one example thats happened a couple of times is that he would lose track of time with his friends and would forget to call me . for example , we call every night at 9 before going to bed and when sometimes when i called him at 9 , hes with his friends still and hell tell me hell call me at 10 . hell often apologize and say he lost track of time but i would just appreciate it that he just tell me in advance that hes with his friends so hell call me later . I am super happy hes with his friends !! but i would like for him to maybe just check the time for a bit to let me know before hand that well call a whole hour later . ive just never lost track of time like that i guess . if I am with my friends and i notice i might miss the call i tell him a few minutes beforehand . I don't know I am pretty by the book so I don't know . another example is that , once i told him that i was going to his house around 6 which is a bit late cause i had to help my parents with something cause of the persian new year . this holiday is a big deal for my family so helping out was important . anyways , the day of , he told me that i should come at 4 cause they had plans so i had to come earlier . i told him that i can come earlier but id have to reschedule things with my parents and everything and that if its possible , to still do 6 . i was upset since i had to change my schedule the day of . however , when i got there , they did nt even leave until 7 so i still could have come at 6 . like , a little bit of better planning and he could have known it was fine to come for me to come at 6 . i just feel as though my time was a bit disrespected . he once got upset that i came 15 minutes late so i was pretty upset that he did nt hold himself to the same standard . i just want to understand how i should handle these sort of situations and if I am being too over dramatic laughing out loud . ik these happen but i feel like i just try more to prevent these last minute issues .\",\n          \"of course this did n't happened today it happened yesterday . rented a room as i am getting married and my mom told it is a good day , so move in today . i moved it and video called my fiancee to show new rented home which is opposite to gym . talked with her standing near window for 10 mins or so . suddenly bell rang i opened door thinking it must be owner . 4 guys where asking why i am recording girls in gym . i had no idea it took me a second , i explained the situation . they seem sweet only they understood its misunderstanding . later my owner who lives downstairs had bit verbal fight with them asking not to barge in . all is calm now . i am bit scared as i am new to this area . i have been using bedsheet as curtains since then ... till my curtain order arrives .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48362,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"i have a crush and my crush likes me back , but my crush is currently in a relationship with one of my friends\",\n          \"* this was a very surprisingly strong and extremely weird experience . i was not at all prepared for the level of dissociation and mind fuck that this combo would give . on the other hand though this combo had some of the best visuals i 've had from any substance so far . i think with a trip sitter and if set during the day , this could have been a near perfect experience . overall 8/10 .\",\n          \"- let us pick between 3 rewards when completing sidequests repeatedly , and make it a small chance that the rewards offered upgrade form rare > epic and even legendaries ! **\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
