thanks for reading this far and please look after yourselves !\",\n          \"so I am 18 f here just because i kind of want to know how i can handle this situation and to know if I am in the wrong / being a bit over dramatic haha , cause i can be sometimes . so my bf and i have been dating for roughly a year now . hes very sweet but he can be very bad with time management and he often loses track of time . i understand things happen , but this happens pretty often and it bugs me . one example thats happened a couple of times is that he would lose track of time with his friends and would forget to call me . for example , we call every night at 9 before going to bed and when sometimes when i called him at 9 , hes with his friends still and hell tell me hell call me at 10 . hell often apologize and say he lost track of time but i would just appreciate it that he just tell me in advance that hes with his friends so hell call me later . I am super happy hes with his friends !! but i would like for him to maybe just check the time for a bit to let me know before hand that well call a whole hour later . ive just never lost track of time like that i guess . if I am with my friends and i notice i might miss the call i tell him a few minutes beforehand . I don't know I am pretty by the book so I don't know . another example is that , once i told him that i was going to his house around 6 which is a bit late cause i had to help my parents with something cause of the persian new year . this holiday is a big deal for my family so helping out was important . anyways , the day of , he told me that i should come at 4 cause they had plans so i had to come earlier . i told him that i can come earlier but id have to reschedule things with my parents and everything and that if its possible , to still do 6 . i was upset since i had to change my schedule the day of . however , when i got there , they did nt even leave until 7 so i still could have come at 6 . like , a little bit of better planning and he could have known it was fine to come for me to come at 6 . i just feel as though my time was a bit disrespected . he once got upset that i came 15 minutes late so i was pretty upset that he did nt hold himself to the same standard . i just want to understand how i should handle these sort of situations and if I am being too over dramatic laughing out loud . ik these happen but i feel like i just try more to prevent these last minute issues .\",\n          \"of course this did n't happened today it happened yesterday . rented a room as i am getting married and my mom told it is a good day , so move in today . i moved it and video called my fiancee to show new rented home which is opposite to gym . talked with her standing near window for 10 mins or so . suddenly bell rang i opened door thinking it must be owner . 4 guys where asking why i am recording girls in gym . i had no idea it took me a second , i explained the situation . they seem sweet only they understood its misunderstanding . later my owner who lives downstairs had bit verbal fight with them asking not to barge in . all is calm now . i am bit scared as i am new to this area . i have been using bedsheet as curtains since then ... till my curtain

i had told him he was free to walk away from me and the baby and i wouldnt chase him up over it or money but he chose to stay and said he wants to be in his sons life . over the past year he has started antidepressants and changes dosage / pill type very regularly obviously prescribed but has been known to skip pills or take several in a day to double up etc. . exbf cut ties with me two days before my due date for another woman he wanted to give things a go with but still talks about ending his life and mentions his super low mood to me when he sees the baby and is frequently pretty nasty to me . he sees our son 3 months typically once a week , sometimes twice up to him , i do nt limit it in my family home and we do nt leave him with the baby alone because he isnt too capable . for a long time he struggled with the practicals eg feeding and changing but hes never been around many babies and is slowly improving - so this isnt much about that . he spends most of the time he has the baby holding him but watching tv or on his phone , he pays little attention to him really . when i pop to the corner shop or chemist etc or go shower i ask my sister or mum to sit with them . our son is still young but some family members have been suggesting soon he will be old enough to spend time with my ex alone eg him take him for a few hours in the day or just even alone in the house but I am not sure i can fully trust my ex . i do nt think he would actively seek to hurt the baby / want to but I am not sure if the background above justifys my choice or if I am overreacting obviously a very brief summary of my reasoning . can anyone shed some light on this ?\",\n          \"i will be the first to admit , i 've got a weight problem , but , i do n't think that justifies him bringing it up to me almost on a daily basis . to his credit though , i suppose , he tries to be nice and , what he considers subtle , other times , if he 's tired or irritated about something else , he 'll snap at me and bring up my weight , for which he apologizes later and we try and work on the communication aspect . i just feel like we go in circles , he brings it up , we talk , we forget , he brings it up again . he does n't feel at all that it 's an off -

thanks for reading this far and please look after yourselves !\",\n          \"so I am 18 f here just because i kind of want to know how i can handle this situation and to know if I am in the wrong / being a bit over dramatic haha , cause i can be sometimes . so my bf and i have been dating for roughly a year now . hes very sweet but he can be very bad with time management and he often loses track of time . i understand things happen , but this happens pretty often and it bugs me . one example thats happened a couple of times is that he would lose track of time with his friends and would forget to call me . for example , we call every night at 9 before going to bed and when sometimes when i called him at 9 , hes with his friends still and hell tell me hell call me at 10 . hell often apologize and say he lost track of time but i would just appreciate it that he just tell me in advance that hes with his friends so hell call me later . I am super happy hes with his friends !! but i would like for him to maybe just check the time for a bit to let me know before hand that well call a whole hour later . ive just never lost track of time like that i guess . if I am with my friends and i notice i might miss the call i tell him a few minutes beforehand . I don't know I am pretty by the book so I don't know . another example is that , once i told him that i was going to his house around 6 which is a bit late cause i had to help my parents with something cause of the persian new year . this holiday is a big deal for my family so helping out was important . anyways , the day of , he told me that i should come at 4 cause they had plans so i had to come earlier . i told him that i can come earlier but id have to reschedule things with my parents and everything and that if its possible , to still do 6 . i was upset since i had to change my schedule the day of . however , when i got there , they did nt even leave until 7 so i still could have come at 6 . like , a little bit of better planning and he could have known it was fine to come for me to come at 6 . i just feel as though my time was a bit disrespected . he once got upset that i came 15 minutes late so i was pretty upset that he did nt hold himself to the same standard . i just want to understand how i should handle these sort of situations and if I am being too over dramatic laughing out loud . ik these happen but i feel like i just try more to prevent these last minute issues .\",\n          \"of course this did n't happened today it happened yesterday . rented a room as i am getting married and my mom told it is a good day , so move in today . i moved it and video called my fiancee to show new rented home which is opposite to gym . talked with her standing near window for 10 mins or so . suddenly bell rang i opened door thinking it must be owner . 4 guys where asking why i am recording girls in gym . i had no idea it took me a second , i explained the situation . they seem sweet only they understood its misunderstanding . later my owner who lives downstairs had bit verbal fight with them asking not to barge in . all is calm now . i am bit scared as i am new to this area . i have been using bedsheet as curtains since then ... till my curtain
